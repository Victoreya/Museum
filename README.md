# Overview
 ## Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Fonts, Bootstrap and jQuery I was able to create a webpage called "Museum of Candy"
 
The HTML code delineates the structure of a webpage dedicated to the "Museum of Candy." 
The page incorporates necessary meta tags, links to external stylesheets for Google Fonts and Bootstrap, and features a responsive navigation bar with links to key sections such as home, about, and tickets.
The content is organized into sections, each consisting of images and descriptive text, providing information about the Museum of Candy. 
Furthermore, the webpage employs custom styling through an external CSS file and incorporates JavaScript to implement a scrolling effect on the navigation bar as users scroll through the page. 
This project showcases web development and design.
